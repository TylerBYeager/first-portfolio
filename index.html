      <h3>Hello!</h3> 
      <h3>My name is Tyler Brian Yeager. I am a former park ranger currently living in the Bay Area and enrolled in a Full-Stack coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley Extension.</h3>
      <p>Allow me to share a bit of my background. I attended the University of Central Arkansas from 2012 to 2016 where I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology.
       Originally I had planned on becoming a famous archaeologist and discovering something that rivaled Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb. 
       Well life had different plans and I found myself working a summer season for Arkansas State Parks. I realized that I enjoyed outdoor recreation and decided to pursue that as a career. 
       Since then I have worked at locations such as Southeast Utah at Bear's Ears National Monument, North-central Colorado, and Northeast Utah where I was fortunate enough to experience new locations, new challenges, new people, and different backgrounds.
       This career taught me much about being a naturalist, using critical thinking to solve problems in fast-paced environments, and how to deal with public relations. While I enjoyed the work, I had realized that it was no longer as challenging and I wanted something more.
       I relocated to the Bay Area in May 2021 where I found the perfect opportunity to learn a new skill and challenge myself. I look forward to this journey and wish to take it as far as I can.

    <h2 id="gallery">Projects</h2>
    <p>I have only been coding for roughly three weeks but I already feel like I am doing things I once considered impossible for me. Here are a few of the projects that I have worked. 
       Personally, I am most proud of the CSS Snippet project as I learned a lot about flexboxes and resolving the final overflow issue with managing 'whitespace' was incredibly satisfying.</p>
