        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Brian Yeager. I am a former park ranger currently living in the Bay Area and enrolled in a Full-Stack coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley Extension.</p>
        <p>Allow me to share a bit of my background. I attended the University of Central Arkansas from 2012 to 2016 where I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology.
           Originally I had planned on becoming a famous archaeologist and discovering something that rivaled Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb. 
           Well life had different plans and I found myself working a summer season for Arkansas State Parks. I realized that I enjoyed outdoor recreation and decided to pursue that as a career. 
           Since then I have worked at locations such as Southeast Utah at Bear's Ears National Monument, North-central Colorado, and Northeast Utah where I was fortunate enough to experience new locations, new challenges, new people, and different backgrounds.
           This career taught me much about being a naturalist, using critical thinking to solve problems in fast-paced environments, and how to deal with public relations. While I enjoyed the work, I had realized that it was no longer as challenging and I wanted something more.
           I relocated to the Bay Area in May 2021 where I found the perfect opportunity to learn a new skill and challenge myself. I look forward to this journey and wish to take it as far as I can.
