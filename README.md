# First-Portfolio 
Hi! My name is Tyler Brian Yeager and I am a Full-Stack developer in training. I am currently enrolled in the full-time Full-Stacking Coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley. The bootcamp began September 14th and ends December 7th by which time I am hoping that my coding skills will be exponentially greater. I have a lot of professional experience at the federal level though not in web developmenet. Over my years of work I have proven myself capable of adapting and learning new skills with enough proficiency to match, and sometimes exceed, the skill levels of my senior coworkers. I hope that this and future portfolios showcase my adaptability as I am looking at a career change and intend to give it my all.  

## Details about this project

This is my attempt at an initial portfolio. This portfolio features a moving color background and heavy use of flexboxes with a "mobile first" approach on responsiveness. It showcases the progress that I've made since beginning my coding journey by providing links to a few projects/mini-projects that I have worked on.

## Getting yourself a copy of this fine portfolio

To get a working copy on your machine you will need a few things such as access to Gitbash or Terminal, a working SSH key, a Github account, and a code reader like VS Code

Getting your clone:

```
Once you have a working SSH key added to your Github account, go to the Code-Refactor Repository. Click the green "code" button on the top right and clonecopy the @github.com link with the SSH key option to your clipboard.

```

Next: 

```
Open Gitbash or Terminal and navigate to a directory that you would like to add the cloned repository. Once in your desired directory type in
"git clone 'right click to paste'" and press enter. This will clone the repository onto your personal machine.
```

Lastly: 

```
Type 'ls' into your Gitbash or Terminal to see a list of items within the directory. If you have done the previous steps correctly then you should see a respository titled "First-Portfolio." Simply type in "code ." to open it in your code editor of choice and have fun!
```
