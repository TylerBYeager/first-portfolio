# First-Portfolio 
Hi! My name is Tyler Brian Yeager. I am a former federal Park Ranger turned Full-Stack developer. This is a pretty basic portfolio but I hope that the linked projects give an idea of how my skills how developed and the work that I am interested in. Please reach out if you have any questions. 

## Details about this project

This is my attempt at an initial portfolio. This portfolio features a moving color background and heavy use of flexboxes with a "mobile first" approach on responsiveness. Contained within are a few of my favorite projects that I feel best show my current abilities.

## Getting yourself a copy of this fine portfolio

To get a working copy on your machine you will need a few things such as access to Gitbash or Terminal, a working SSH key, a Github account, and a code reader like VS Code

Getting your clone:

```
Once you have a working SSH key added to your Github account, go to the "first-portfolio" Repository. Click the green "code" button on the top right and clonecopy the @github.com link with the SSH key option to your clipboard. 
```

Next: 

```
Open Gitbash or Terminal and navigate to a directory that you would like to add the cloned repository. Once in your desired directory type in
"git clone 'right click to paste'" and press enter. This will clone the repository onto your personal machine.
```

Lastly: 

```
Type 'ls' into your Gitbash or Terminal to see a list of items within the directory. If you have done the previous steps correctly then you should see a respository titled "First-Portfolio." Simply type in "code ." to open it in your code editor of choice and have fun!
```
